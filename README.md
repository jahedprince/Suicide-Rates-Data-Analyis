# Suicide-Rates-Data-Analyis
Data Analysis of Suicide Rates by Countries, Gender and Income

Suicide is an intense complex issue that occurs throughout the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals every year around the world. It is an extremely sensitive topic and one that society tends to ignore. The stigma around mental illnesses and suicide should be removed from society and discussed openly. Furthermore, itâ€™s important that we speak more on it so we can find the best approaches toward prevention.

The goal for this project is to explore the statisitcs of suicide rates by conitnent, age, gender, and income using Python on Jupyter Notebook. I will also look to see if there is a statisically significant difference in the suicide rates between men and women. By finding these different statistics, I gain to bring more awareness to this topic.
